Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Git workflow

**Always push straight to `main` after every change.** This project does not use
feature branches or pull requests for normal work — commit each change and push
it directly to `main`.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "…"
git push origin main
```

## Project

A Cloudflare Worker that serves a static chat UI (`public/`) and a streaming
`/api/chat` endpoint. Deployed via `npx wrangler deploy` (config in
`wrangler.toml`), git-connected to Cloudflare.

**Product intent:** the site is a *deep research* assistant, matching its
name. `/api/chat` runs a Worker-orchestrated pipeline (`src/pipeline.js`,
handler scaffold in `src/chat.js`) — no function calling; every phase is a
direct call, so it is deterministic and works on any JSON-mode model:

1. **Triage** (JSON mode): direct reply | one clarifying question | research
   plan with 2–4 queries covering different angles.
2. **Search wave**: planned queries via Exa, deduped, capped by the
   budget plan (`plan.maxSearches`).
3. **Gap check** (JSON, rounds set by the plan): audit coverage, run
   follow-up queries for missing angles.
4. **Synthesis** (streamed): answer built ONLY from the numbered source
   registry, `[n]` citations + "Sources:" list.
5. **Post-validation** (JSON): fact-check the draft against the sources; on
   "revise" the UI discards the draft (`discard_text`) and the corrected
   answer is emitted.

Helper phases fail soft (degrade to fewer searches / accepted draft — never
break the request). Search/round caps come from the time-budget planner
(`src/budget.js`).

**Time budget:** the UI slider (15 s–10 min; the clock symbol IS the thumb;
position maps quadratically to seconds for fine low-end granularity;
persisted) sends `time_budget_s` with each request; `src/budget.js` plans
the spend. Per-model EWMA stats of
each phase's duration (seeded with measured priors, per isolate, fed by
every completed phase) drive a static allocation — triage+synthesis always
paid, validation reserved next (quality gate, dropped only under tight
budgets), ~60% of the rest buys 1–4 search angles, the remainder buys gap
rounds — plus runtime deadline checks between phases (budget +15% grace;
extra gap rounds are cut first, validation last, with a visible
"Validation skipped" step when it happens).

**Model-specific adaptations (`src/model-profiles.js`):** the pipeline is
designed to be model-agnostic (no function calling, plain JSON-mode
calls — see above), but real models still differ in speed and JSON
reliability. `getModelProfile(modelId)` returns per-model overrides,
consulted at the few places that need them; models with no entry behave
exactly as if this module didn't exist. Fields: `priorsMs` (per-phase
duration overrides `budget.js`'s `phaseEstimates()` falls back to ONLY
until that model's own in-isolate EWMA has real data — for a model
evidenced to be much slower than the global priors assume, this makes a
COLD isolate plan conservatively for it from the first request, not just
after the EWMA warms up), `jsonReinforcement` (splices an extra "JSON
object only, no preamble" line into the JSON-mode prompts, for a model
that tends to preface its JSON with reasoning/prose), `maxTokensOverride`
(per-phase `max_tokens` bump for `completeJson` calls), and
`skipValidation` (stop attempting the post-validation phase entirely for
a model whose validate call has been evidenced to reliably fail to
produce a usable verdict — same "draft kept as-is" outcome the fail-soft
path already gives, without the wasted latency/tokens). **Keep this
evidence-driven**: every entry should trace back to a reproduced finding,
not a guess. `tests/model-eval.mjs` is the tool for finding them — it
runs a fixed research-query battery against every model in the live
catalog and surfaces per-model failure/quirk patterns from the resulting
SSE traces (see that file's header for methodology and how to re-run it
when Berget's catalog changes).

Not every finding from that harness is model-specific, though: a round 2
battery surfaced requests that died silently mid-pipeline for a few
models — no error, no client-visible failure, just a stream that stopped.
Workers Logs showed several phases completing normally then nothing, with
`chat.complete` never firing — the signature of an awaited `fetch()` that
never settles, not a thrown/caught exception. Root cause: `src/berget.js`'s
two Berget calls had **no timeout at all**, so a hung backend response
could silently defeat every fail-soft path in this pipeline. Fixed
universally (not via a model profile) — `completeJson` bounds the whole
call at 45s, `chatCompletion` bounds only the time to receive a response
(30s) so a legitimately long stream can still be read afterward. Verified
live: the previously flaky models went from 1-4 failures per 5 queries to
0-1.

### Code layout

Server (`src/`):

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `index.js` | Entrypoint: request id, identity gate, terms + approval gates, routing (`/api/*`, `/admin`, `/auth/google*`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/terms/accept`), sliding-cookie reissue, request logs |
| `auth.js` | Identity: session cookie (365 d, sliding) + admin-secrets break-glass Basic Auth (fail closed); OAuth state HMAC helpers |
| `google.js` | Google OIDC sign-in: state cookie, code exchange, claims validation, auto-provisioning (`ADMIN_EMAIL` → admin) |
| `login.js` | Sign-in, pending-approval, and one-time terms pages (PWAs can't answer a 401 challenge) |
| `accounts.js` | User accounts CRUD (D1; provisioned by Google sign-in, no passwords) |
| `db.js` | Optional D1 binding + lazy schema (no-op without the binding) |
| `config.js` | Global site config (D1 `config` table, admin-edited, cached ~30 s) |
| `quota.js` | Window usage accounting, quota enforcement, cost calc, usage recording |
| `user-api.js` | `/api/me` (usage vs quota) + `/api/models` (dropdown catalog) + `/api/client-error` (beacon) |
| `answers.js` | `/api/chat/answer`: TTL'd (15 min) answer recovery cache for dropped connections — ack-purged on intact delivery |
| `admin-api.js` | `/api/admin/*`: overview, invites, requests, users, config |
| `chat.js` | `/api/chat` handler: validation, model resolution, quota gate, state, SSE scaffold, usage recording |
| `pipeline.js` | The research pipeline (triage → search → gap → synth → validate) |
| `prompts.js` | All LLM prompt builders |
| `validation.js` | Request validation (messages, images) + model/vision resolution |
| `conversation.js` | Message-array utilities (textOf, image parts, formatting) |
| `budget.js` | Time-budget planner: per-model EWMA stats, plan, deadline checks |
| `model-profiles.js` | Evidence-driven per-model overrides (priors, JSON reinforcement, validation skip) |
| `berget.js` | Berget client: streaming + JSON-mode completions (both fetch calls time-bounded — see below), model catalog (incl. raw per-token pricing) |
| `exa.js` | Exa web search |
| `log.js` | Structured JSON logger (`LOG_LEVEL` var) |
| `http.js` | Response helpers (json, SSE) |

Client (`public/`): `index.html` (markup only) + `css/app.css` +
ES modules in `js/` — `app.js` (bootstrap/wiring: scrolling, slider,
search knob, composer), `stream.js` (conversation history + `/api/chat`
SSE send loop), `models.js` (model dropdown), `attachments.js` (pending
images/docs, downscaling), `account.js` (account & usage panel),
`turns.js` (bubbles/content/tools), `activity.js` (step bars, stats,
collapse), `markdown.js` (sanitized rendering), `timescale.js` (slider
scale). Admin UI: `admin/index.html` + `js/admin.js` + `css/admin.css`
(served only to admins). Vendored libs in `vendor/` (`marked`,
`DOMPurify`).

### /api/chat SSE protocol

OpenAI-style text deltas plus custom `status` events that the UI renders as
live activity (spinners, expandable sources, stats). Clients must ignore
unknown `status` types (forward compatibility).

- `{"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"…"}}]}` — text chunk
- `{"status":{"type":"step_start","id":"plan","label":"Analyzing request…"}}` — pipeline step spinner
- `{"status":{"type":"step_done","id":"plan","label":"Planned 3 search angles","details":["query …"]}}` — checkmark; `details` renders as an expandable list
- `{"status":{"type":"search_start","round":1,"query":"…"}}` — spinner on
- `{"status":{"type":"search_done","round":1,"query":"…","results":5,"duration_ms":830,"sources":[{"title":"…","url":"…"}]}}` — expandable source list
- `{"status":{"type":"discard_text"}}` — clear the answer streamed so far and
  keep waiting (post-validation found problems; the corrected answer follows)
- `{"status":{"type":"done","model":"mistralai/…","rounds":2,"searches":4,"duration_ms":6400,"prompt_tokens":1234,"completion_tokens":97,"co2_grams":0.013}}` — stats footer
- `{"error":"…"}` — shown as an error in the bubble
- Stream terminates with `data: [DONE]`

## End-to-end tests (`tests/`)

Playwright suite that runs against the **live site** using the
break-glass credentials (`BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` env vars;
sent as an `Authorization: Basic` header on every request — the Worker
never emits a challenge, so Playwright's `httpCredentials` would not
work). Self-contained npm project — nothing at the repo root, so the
Worker build is untouched.

```bash
cd tests && npm install && npm run fixtures   # once
npm run test:mocked   # 29 tests, free: /api/chat intercepted
npm run test:live     # 4 tests, real Berget tokens + one Exa run
```

- **Fixtures** are generated by `make_fixtures.py` (stdlib only): txt/md,
  a hand-built single-page PDF, deflated AND stored docx (with entities,
  tabs, breaks), solid-color PNGs, an over-cap txt, a rejected csv. Each
  carries a unique `*-SENTINEL-*` code.
- **mocked project**: uploads run through the real UI and the real
  client-side parsers (pdf.js, the ZIP reader); assertions target the
  captured `/api/chat` request payload (sentinels, doc-block headers,
  multimodal parts, caps, truncation) and the downloaded report PDF
  (attached JPEGs must appear byte-for-byte inside it). `api.spec.js`
  hits real server-side validation (400s — no spend).
- **live project**: serial, retried once (LLM wording varies): sentinel
  echo from parsed docs, vision reading an uploaded image + live report
  embed, and one budget-capped web-search run combining Exa with a
  doc + image attachment.
- **Sandbox quirks** (encoded in `playwright.config.js`): Chromium must
  be pointed at the env's `HTTPS_PROXY` explicitly, `ignoreHTTPSErrors`
  for the re-signing CA, and `--ssl-version-max=tls1.2` because the
  proxy resets Chromium's TLS 1.3 ClientHello; the browser binary is the
  pre-installed `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`.

**Model-matrix eval (`tests/model-eval.mjs`)**: a separate tool from the
Playwright suite above — a plain Node script (no deps) that runs a fixed
battery of research queries against every `up` model from `/api/models`
directly via the live SSE endpoint, to find per-model behavior
differences (see `src/model-profiles.js`). Not pass/fail; it's a
data-collection sweep whose output is read and analyzed by hand.
Multiple named query sets exist in `QUERY_SETS` (`round1`, `round2`, ...)
— add a new named set for a fresh sweep rather than editing an old one,
so past findings stay reproducible against the exact set that produced
them. Queries can be multi-turn (`turns: [...]`): the harness resends the
ACTUAL streamed answer as the assistant turn for the next request, the
same as the real client, to exercise conversation-context handling
(e.g. triage resolving "this"/"it" from a prior turn) rather than
simulating it.

```bash
cd tests && npm run eval:models   # BASIC_AUTH_USER/PASS required
# EVAL_QUERY_SET=round2 EVAL_MODELS=id1,id2 EVAL_BUDGET_S=60 EVAL_CONCURRENCY=3 are optional overrides
```

Results land in `tests/model-eval-results/<timestamp>/` (gitignored — raw
model output, no lasting repo value): one JSON file per model×query run
(full SSE event sequence, final answer, a heuristic scan for leaked
tool-call-shaped tokens) plus a `_summary.json`. Re-run this whenever
Berget's catalog changes materially (new model, or a model profiled in
`model-profiles.js` gets updated by its provider) to check whether
existing overrides still apply and whether new ones are needed.

**Don't commit (or otherwise deploy) mid-battery.** A push to `main`
triggers Cloudflare's auto-deploy, which can silently truncate in-flight
streamed requests the battery is relying on — this produced a batch of
confusing zero-answer results during the round 2 battery (traced to a
mid-run `git push`, not a real bug) before being caught and re-run clean.
Let a battery finish before pushing anything.

## UI notes

- Assistant answers render as **Markdown by default** (synthesis prompt asks
  for Markdown). Rendering is client-side with vendored `marked` +
  `DOMPurify` (`public/vendor/` — no CDN; everything stays behind auth).
  Always sanitize: answers can quote hostile web content. Each answer has
  Raw (plain-text toggle), Copy, and **PDF** buttons — PDF generates a
  branded DeepResearch.se report client-side via vendored jsPDF
  (`public/js/report.js`; the 360KB lib is script-injected on first use
  only). The report **embeds the images the user attached to the
  question** as figures under the title: the turn object carries the
  sent data URLs (`turns.js` ← `stream.js`) and jsPDF stores the
  downscaled JPEGs verbatim (the e2e suite byte-matches them inside the
  file). The PDF is saved via the native share sheet on touch devices and
  an `<a download>` click elsewhere — NEVER jsPDF's own `doc.save()`,
  whose Safari fallback navigates the page and aborts in-flight fetches
  (this killed a streaming answer in production). Belt-and-suspenders:
  the button waits (`"when done"`) while a research stream is running.
- **Document attachments** (`public/js/docs.js`): the paperclip accepts
  images AND `pdf`/`docx`/`md`/`txt`. Docs are parsed entirely client-side
  (txt/md directly; pdf via vendored pdf.js, dynamically imported on first
  PDF; docx via a minimal ZIP reader + `DecompressionStream("deflate-raw")`
  — no library) and embedded as labeled text blocks in the API message
  (never shown in the bubble, which gets 📄 chips). Caps: 3 docs × 9K chars
  (fits the server's 32K message limit), 4 images. Attachments render as
  rounded cards with a white circular ✕, on their own line at the BOTTOM
  of the composer pane (`#pending` after the form).
- Processing indicators are the site icon pulsing (`pulse-screw` keyframes).
- **Floating chrome (no hide/show):** header and footer are FIXED,
  click-transparent strips (`pointer-events: none`) whose glass items
  re-enable pointer events — content scrolls beneath the chrome and
  stays visible between the items and through their translucency. The
  header stacks TWO rows: the brand as plain characters (no pane, soft
  white text-glow, never captures clicks) and beneath it the glass
  controls row (New chat, model selector, account button). `#chat`
  carries top/bottom padding (5.6rem / 8rem) so the first and last
  messages can scroll clear of the fixed items.
- **Background life:** `body::before` drifts a repeating diagonal gradient
  (tiny white/navy alphas) across the sky blue — one full 280px period per
  26s loop so it's seamless; disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Glass chrome:** the header is transparent with the title in smaller
  type and each control (New chat, model selector, account) as its own
  frosted-glass container; the whole input area is ONE glass pane
  (`#composer`, rounded, backdrop-blur over the drifting waves): a
  single-line auto-growing text input on top (Enter inserts a LINE BREAK
  — only the arrow button sends; grows to ~6 lines), and beneath it the
  attach button (round),
  **web-search knob** (default on; sends `web_search: false` when off →
  the Worker skips triage/Exa entirely and streams one Berget
  completion), 🔍 info popover, the slider filling the remaining space,
  then the spelled-out time value (loupe/slider/value all dim while
  search is off), and a round accent **arrow send button**. "New chat"
  in the header clears the client-side history.
- **User documentation** at `/help/` (auth-gated static page): every
  control explained with real screenshots (`public/help/img/`, captured
  via Playwright) and the privacy meaning of each — linked from the
  account panel. Re-capture the screenshots when the composer/header
  changes visibly.
- **"About this project"** at `/build/` (auth-gated static page, linked
  from the account panel): states the site's actual purpose — a
  demonstration of building a SaaS-style app over a weekend, **entirely
  through the Claude Code iPhone app** (domain purchase, every deploy,
  every service configured, source/config never viewed directly on any
  other device — the one exception being the D1 database UUID, which had
  to be hand-copied from the Cloudflare dashboard URL; source:
  https://github.com/kristerhedfors/Deepresearch.se), invite-only and
  never placed on the market — plus a
  restricted-use-cases section grounded in the EU AI Act (Article 5
  prohibited practices mapped onto a text research tool, and an honest
  read of why the Article 2(6)/2(8) research and pre-market exemptions
  don't cleanly apply to continuous real-world use by invited people).
- **"The build story"** at `/story/` (auth-gated static page, its own
  top-level account-panel entry): fetches and renders
  `public/build/history.md` (the complete, prompt-by-prompt build
  history, moved from `docs/` so it's part of the shipped product and
  not just a repo file) via the same vendored `marked`/`DOMPurify`
  pipeline the chat UI uses, flowing with normal page scroll — and
  NEVER sideways: tables and code wrap instead of forcing width. Append
  to `history.md`, not rewrite — it's a chronological record; keep
  adding a new section per session the way earlier entries did.
- **Account panel** (`public/js/account.js`) is two levels: the default
  view shows only the rolling 5-hour window (the one that actually gates
  the next message) plus navigation (Full usage & history, About this
  project, The build story, Documentation, Admin, Sign out); "Full usage
  & history" drills into today/this-week/this-month. Both views re-render
  from one cached `/api/me` response.
- **Privacy notice** on first visit (Berget/Exa processing, metadata-only
  logs, no stored conversations — except the ≤15 min answer-recovery
  buffer, disclosed in the notice); acknowledgement remembered for a year
  in the `dr_privacy_ack` cookie.
- **Public surface** (`isPublicAsset` in `src/index.js`) — served without
  auth: branding (`/favicon.ico`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/icons/*` —
  iOS/Chrome fetch these *without* credentials, so gating them silently
  breaks PWA icons) plus the **promotional surface**: `/welcome/` (the
  landing page), `/help/`, `/build/`, `/story/`, the promo video
  (`/llm-assiterad-utveckling.mp4`), and the support files those pages
  render with (`/js/markdown.js`, vendored `marked`/`DOMPurify` — all
  public on GitHub anyway). The app itself and every `/api/*` stay gated.
- **Landing page** (`public/welcome/index.html`): signed-out visitors
  hitting `/` get this promotional page (hero, the promo video, cards to
  story/about/docs/GitHub, a sign-in CTA noting invite-only approval)
  instead of a bare login form; `/login` remains the explicit sign-in
  page and the target for auth bounces on other paths. Signed-in users
  at `/` get the app, as always.

## Logging & observability

- Structured JSON logs, one object per line: `{time, level, event,
  request_id, ...}`. Levels `debug|info|warn|error` via the `LOG_LEVEL` var
  (default `info`).
- Event names: `request.complete` / `request.failed`, `auth.denied`,
  `chat.round`, `chat.complete` (carries `client_gone` and `user_id`),
  `chat.client_disconnected` (client aborted the SSE stream — backgrounded
  PWA or dropped network, NOT a server failure), `chat.stream_failed`,
  `chat.client_error` (the CLIENT's own view of a died stream, reported
  via `navigator.sendBeacon` to `/api/client-error`: browser error string,
  `was_hidden`, chars received, and `chat_request_id` for correlating with
  the server-side trace), `exa.search`, `exa.error`.
- **SSE keepalive**: `/api/chat` emits a `: keepalive` comment line every
  15 s so idle-connection timeouts can't kill the stream during quiet
  phases (triage/gap/validation emit nothing for tens of seconds).
  Disconnect detection is the stream's `cancel()` hook + enqueue
  failures — note neither fires in `wrangler dev` local (client aborts
  don't propagate there), so verify via production Workers Logs.
- **Answer recovery (`src/answers.js`)**: on client disconnect the
  pipeline does NOT abort — it finishes (the spend is mostly committed
  by then) and parks the final answer + stats in the D1 `answers` table
  keyed by request id. Every request writes a metadata-only `running`
  marker at stream start and the full answer at completion; the client
  acks intact deliveries with `DELETE /api/chat/answer?id=…` (content
  normally lives server-side for seconds) and polls
  `GET /api/chat/answer?id=…` after a died stream to re-render the
  completed answer. Rows expire after 15 min (`ANSWER_TTL_MS`,
  lazy-purged on every read/write) — the privacy notice discloses this
  explicitly; it is a recovery buffer, not storage.
- **Disconnect survival**: the pipeline promise is registered with
  `ctx.waitUntil()` — without it the runtime kills the invocation the
  moment the client vanishes, silently dropping the `chat.complete` log
  AND the `usage_events` accounting row (observed in production: a trace
  that just stops mid-pipeline). With it, the finally block always runs.
- Stream errors shown in the UI carry a short `(ref xxxxxxxx)` — the
  first 8 chars of the request id, quotable straight into a log search.
- `BERGET_URL` env override exists solely so local tests can point the
  Berget client at a mock; production uses the default.
- **Privacy:** never log secrets or chat message content. User-provided text
  (e.g. search queries) is logged at `debug` level only; `info`+ logs carry
  counts, durations, statuses, and token usage.
- Every response carries an `x-request-id` header — use it to find the
  matching log entries.
- `[observability] enabled = true` in `wrangler.toml` persists logs to
  Workers Logs (dashboard: Worker → Logs). Live tail: `npx wrangler tail`.
- On `/api/chat`, `request.complete` fires when the SSE headers are returned;
  `chat.complete` (rounds, searches, duration) marks the end of the stream.

## LLM provider — Berget.ai

**This project uses Berget.ai, NOT Anthropic.** Berget exposes an
OpenAI-compatible API at `https://api.berget.ai/v1`.

- **Auth:** the Worker reads the `BERGET_API_TOKEN` secret (already configured
  on the Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard) and sends it as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Never hardcode the token in the repo.
- **Model:** defaults to **Mistral Small**
  (`mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506`, alias `mistral-small`),
  overridable via the optional `BERGET_MODEL` env var. Other models available
  in Berget's repo can be found at `GET https://api.berget.ai/v1/models`.
- **Model dropdown:** the UI lets users pick a model. `GET /api/models`
  (Worker) proxies Berget's catalog filtered to text models that support
  streaming + JSON mode (the research pipeline's planning/validation calls
  require it), cached ~5 min per isolate (`src/berget.js`). Models Berget reports as down (e.g.
  `status.up: false`, lifecycle `maintenance`) are included with `up: false`
  and rendered greyed out/disabled — they become selectable automatically
  when Berget brings them back. The client sends `model` in the `POST
  /api/chat` body; the Worker validates it (400 on unknown or down models)
  and falls back to the default if the catalog is unreachable. Selection
  persists in `localStorage`.
- **API shape:** OpenAI-style `POST /v1/chat/completions` with
  `stream: true`; SSE deltas arrive as `choices[0].delta.content`, terminated
  by `data: [DONE]`.
- **Image input:** models with `capabilities.vision` (exposed as `vision` in
  `/api/models`) accept OpenAI-style multimodal content:
  `content: [{type:"text",text}, {type:"image_url",image_url:{url:"data:image/…"}}]`.
  The attach button stays tappable on non-vision models (dimmed, not
  disabled — tooltips don't exist on touch devices) and offers a one-tap
  switch to a vision-capable model; the Worker rejects
  images on non-vision models (400 listing vision-capable alternatives).
  **Berget rejects request bodies over ~1 MB** ("Request payload too large";
  measured 2026-07: 1.0M chars OK, 1.2M rejected), so the client downscales
  images before attaching (canvas → JPEG, max 1280px, quality ladder, ≤280K
  chars/image, ≤700K/message) and strips images from all but the latest
  message when resending history. Server caps in `src/validation.js`: 4
  images/message, 8/request, 300K chars/image, 750K total. Image parts of
  the latest user message are forwarded to the synthesis call so research
  can use them; image-only sends get an explicit analyze instruction; JSON
  helper phases are text-only and see an `[N image(s) attached]` marker.

## Web search — Exa

**Canonical reference:** https://docs.exa.ai/reference/search-api-guide-for-coding-agents
— the source of truth for search types, parameters, and response shape. Fetch it
if anything here looks stale, and report staleness back.

Searches are orchestrated by the Worker pipeline in `src/pipeline.js` (no
function calling): the triage/gap-check phases plan queries via JSON-mode
calls, the Worker runs them against Exa, and synthesis answers from the
accumulated numbered source registry.

**Retention reality — Exa is NOT zero-data-retention by default.** Exa
retains query data on the standard API plan; true ZDR is an
enterprise-only arrangement (https://exa.ai/blog/zdr-search-engine),
which this site does not have. The documented workaround is the
**two-step semi-private workflow** (user docs: `/help/` → "Sensitive
topics", hinted in the 🔍 popover): (1) web search ON, ask a *generic*,
impersonal question on the subject so the pipeline pulls sources into
the conversation; (2) web search OFF, ask the real/specific questions —
the model answers from the in-context sources, nothing further reaches
Exa. Only AI-derived short queries ever go to Exa (never the
conversation), but a query still reveals the topic. Keep the help page,
popover, and privacy notice in sync if the search provider or plan
changes (an Exa ZDR enterprise plan would obsolete these warnings).

- **Auth:** the Worker reads the `EXA_API_KEY` secret and sends it as the
  `x-api-key` header. Never hardcode it. (Exa returns HTTP 402 without a key.)
- **Endpoint:** `POST https://api.exa.ai/search` (REST — the Worker is JS, so we
  do NOT use the `exa_py` Python SDK).
- **Request:** `{ query, type: "auto", numResults: 5, contents: { highlights: true } }`.
  `type: "auto"` balances relevance/speed; `highlights` returns token-efficient
  excerpts (preferred for LLM use over full `text`).
- **Response:** `data.results[]`, each with `title`, `url`, `highlights[]`.
- **Common mistakes:** `text`/`summary`/`highlights` must be nested under
  `contents` on `/search` (they're top-level only on `/contents`); `useAutoprompt`,
  `livecrawl`, `numSentences` are deprecated; use `includeDomains`/`excludeDomains`
  (not `includeUrls`). Search volume is capped by the time-budget plan
  (`plan.maxSearches` — `src/budget.js`).

## Access control & accounts — Google sign-in only

The whole site (UI + API) is gated; `run_worker_first = true` ensures auth
also covers the static assets. **The only user-facing sign-in is Google**
(OIDC authorization-code flow, server side, no SDK — `src/google.js`;
secrets `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, configured on the
Worker; setup reference: `docs/GOOGLE-AUTH.md`).

- **Terms gate (first sign-in)**: every D1 account must accept the terms
  of use ONCE before anything else — a single server-rendered page
  (`termsPage` in `src/login.js`, enforced in `src/index.js` ahead of the
  approval gate) condensing the `/build/` "About this project" text: what
  the site is, the EU AI Act Article 5 prohibited-use list, the privacy
  summary, one Accept button (`POST /terms/accept`). Acceptance is stamped
  as `terms_accepted_at` on the user row (additive D1 migration). `/build/`
  and `/story/` stay readable pre-acceptance (the full text the page
  summarizes); break-glass is exempt (no user row). Deliberately one
  page, once — keep it that way; no consent-page sprawl.
- **Auto-provisioning + approval gate**: any Google account with a
  **verified** email can sign in; the first sign-in creates the D1 user
  row. The `ADMIN_EMAIL` variable (set in the Cloudflare dashboard, not
  in wrangler.toml — kept out of the repo) gets — and keeps — the admin
  role, always active. Everyone else lands as status **`pending`** (config
  `require_approval`, default on): they hold a session but only ever see
  an auto-refreshing "awaiting approval" page — no APIs, no cost — until
  the admin clicks Approve in `/admin`, which takes effect on their next
  request with no re-login. Turning `require_approval` off makes new
  sign-ins active immediately (quota-capped). The admin can
  approve/disable/delete users and edit quotas in `/admin` (status is
  re-checked per request, so disabling is immediate; existing sessions
  die too). **Sole-admin policy**: the admin role is assigned only via
  `ADMIN_EMAIL` at sign-in — the admin API deliberately cannot change
  roles, so no other account can ever be promoted.
- **Flow**: `GET /auth/google` (signed single-use state cookie, CSRF) →
  Google → `GET /auth/google/callback` (code exchange server-to-server;
  claims validated: `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `email_verified === true`;
  Google's stable `sub` stored on the user row) → session cookie → `/`.
  ID-token signature is not verified — it arrives directly from Google's
  token endpoint over TLS (per Google's own guidance for this flow).
- **Sessions (PWA longevity)**: `dr_session` = `u.<uid>.<exp>.<hmac>`,
  **365 days, sliding** — any authenticated request past the half-life
  gets a fresh cookie appended, so an installed PWA opened at least twice
  a year never re-logs-in. HttpOnly + server-set also exempts it from
  Safari ITP's 7-day cap on script-writable storage. HMAC is keyed from
  the admin credential pair — rotating `ADMIN_PASS` logs everyone out.
- **Break-glass**: the `ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASS` secrets (legacy
  fallback `BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`BASIC_AUTH_PASS`) still work over HTTP Basic
  Auth (`curl -u …`; never via any form) — for scripts and emergencies;
  needs no DB, no Google; exempt from quotas (usage still recorded as
  user `admin`). The Worker **fails closed** if these secrets are unset
  (they also key the session HMAC). No `WWW-Authenticate` challenge is
  ever emitted.
- `GOOGLE_AUTH_URL` / `GOOGLE_TOKEN_URL` env overrides exist solely so
  local tests can point the flow at a mock; production uses the defaults.

**Quotas — real-cost-grounded**: per FOUR windows (a **rolling
last-5-hours** window, Claude Code-style, plus UTC calendar day / ISO
week / month), two dimensions:
- **budget_eur** (Berget): a genuine COST cap — every request's Berget
  cost is computed as tokens × that model's actual per-token catalog
  prices and summed against the budget (different models price
  differently, so tokens alone can't cap spend). **Opaque to users**:
  `/api/chat`/`/api/me` never emit amounts — users get only a percentage
  bar ("Research budget · 43%") and, on 429, the period + reset time.
- **searches** (Exa): a count cap — Exa bills per search, so the count IS
  the cost; users see the counts.
Deliberately NO time limits. Global defaults + per-user overrides (admin
"Quota…" editor); 0 = no cap. Rolling-window resets are estimated from
when the oldest event inside ages out. Every stream records a
`usage_events` row (model, tokens, searches, berget/exa cost split,
duration). **Admins are never blocked**: enforcement (the 429 gate)
applies to regular users only — admin usage is still recorded and their
panel bars keep counting past 100% (`enforced: false` in `/api/me`).
Usage under the break-glass identity (secrets Basic Auth or legacy
pre-Google cookies) is recorded as user `admin` and shown as its own
row in `/admin`, so no spend is invisible. The ADMIN sees everything: `/admin` aggregates cost + counts
per window site-wide, per user (budget bars in €, tokens + total-cost
lines), and **per model** (token counts and what they actually cost —
the granular ground truth behind the budgets). Note the usage SQL
filters from the MINIMUM of all window starts — the ISO week can begin
before the month does.

**Admin interface** at `/admin` (role-gated; non-admins get 302 → `/`):
usage totals, user management (role/status/quota/delete), config (default
quotas, Exa cost, max time budget, default model — stored in the D1
`config` table, cached ~30 s per isolate).

**D1 setup (one-time)**: `npx wrangler d1 create deepresearch-se`, paste
the id into the `[[d1_databases]]` block in `wrangler.toml`, push. Schema
auto-applies on first use (plus guarded additive ALTERs). Without the
binding everything degrades gracefully: break-glass auth only, Google
sign-in bounces with a clear message, no quotas.

Secrets are set in the dashboard (Worker → Settings → Variables and
Secrets) or via CLI: `ADMIN_USER`, `ADMIN_PASS`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (plus `BERGET_API_TOKEN`, `EXA_API_KEY`).
`ADMIN_EMAIL` is a plaintext dashboard *variable* (not in wrangler.toml,
so it stays out of the public repo). The full from-scratch install guide
is in `README.md`.
