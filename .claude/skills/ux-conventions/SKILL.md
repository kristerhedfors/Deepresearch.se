  Load when adding or changing any INTERACTION behavior in the client UI —
  popovers / speech bubbles / explainers and how they dismiss, what a click on
  overlay chrome does, which gesture opens a control, focus/return behavior —
  or when a UX decision has just been made that must stay consistent across the
  app and won't be caught by a unit test. This is the numbered REGISTRY of
  codified UX interaction rules ("when X happens, the UI does Y"), each pinned
  to its canonical implementation. Consult it BEFORE writing new interaction
  code so the new surface matches the established feel; ADD an entry whenever a
  new UX rule is decided. Companion to ui-notes (which covers UI facts/markup);
  this skill is specifically the behavioral "when-then" rules.

# UX conventions

This is the **registry of codified user-experience interaction rules** for the
client (`public/`). These are cross-cutting *behaviors* — "when the user does X,
the UI does Y" — that must feel the same everywhere and that no unit test
enforces, so they drift unless written down. `ui-notes` documents UI *facts*
(markup, rendering, attachments, the report); **this skill documents
interaction *behavior*.**

## How to use this skill

- **Before** wiring a new interactive surface (a popover, an overlay, a
  dismissable panel, a new gesture), find the matching convention below and copy
  its established behavior — don't reinvent a slightly-different feel.
- **When a new UX decision is made**, add a numbered entry: the RULE as a
  precise "when X → then Y", a one-line WHY, and the `file:line` of the
  canonical implementation(s). Keep it evidence-based — describe what the code
  actually does, and update the reference if the canonical implementation moves.
- Each rule has EN+SV parity only where it routes on text; pure interaction
  rules (dismissal, gestures) are language-agnostic.

## UX-1 — Speaker bubbles dismiss on any outside interaction; live content inside stays clickable

**Rule.** When a transient **speaker bubble / popover / explainer** is open, an
interaction (click or pointer-down) **anywhere** dismisses it and returns the
user to whatever was underneath — **except** an interaction that lands on
*interactive content inside the bubble*, or on the control that opened it, which
is handled normally and does **not** dismiss. A bubble that holds no interactive
content is therefore purely dismiss-on-click: click it, it closes, you're back
to what was under it.

**Why.** These bubbles are lightweight, non-modal asides (an info blurb, a
"this is a Se/rver feature" explainer, a mascot's hint, a settings detail). They
must never trap the user: the natural instinct — click away to get rid of it —
always works, while the one thing you might actually want to touch inside
(a link, a select, a form field, a dismiss ✕) still works. No modal backdrop, no
"you must press the X."

**The mechanics that make it consistent (match all of these):**

1. **The outside-closer** is bound to `document` (or a *persistent* ancestor),
   and hides the bubble when the event target is **not** inside it —
   `!pop.contains(e.target)` — plus **not** on the opener
   (`!e.target.closest(<opener-selector>)`), so the same click that opens
   doesn't immediately re-close.
2. **The opener swallows its own click** (`e.stopPropagation()` / `preventDefault`
   when a hold fired) so opening is not also an "outside" event, and a
   press-and-hold that opened the bubble does **not** also toggle the underlying
   control.
3. **One bubble at a time** — `closeAll()` before opening a new one.
4. **Bind the outside-closer ONCE** on a persistent element (guard with a flag
   like `_popCloserBound`), never per-render, or the handlers stack and a bubble
   needs N clicks to close.
5. **Interactive content inside stays live** because the closer's containment
   check excludes the whole bubble subtree — a `<select>`, link, input, or the
   ✕ inside receives its own event normally.
6. **Choose the event by whether dismiss should beat the underlay:** use
   **`click`** when closing after the underlying element reacts is fine
   (settings/search/DRS popovers); use **`pointerdown` in capture phase** when
   the bubble must get out of the way *before* the tapped element acts (the TIN
   mascot bubble).

**Canonical implementations** (copy the nearest one):

| Surface | File | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Settings info popovers (press-and-hold or ⓘ) | `public/js/account-views.js` `wireSettingPopovers` (~L188) | Excludes `.setting-pop` and `.setting-info`; closer bound once via `root._popCloserBound`; `closeAll()` on open; opener `stopPropagation`s. The reference implementation. |
| Web-search spiderweb popover | `public/js/app.js` (~L206) | `document` click closer, `!searchPop.contains(e.target)`; the press-and-hold opener guards `holdFired` so the hold doesn't also flip the toggle. |
| `#drspop` DRS-feature explainer (DRC/cure) | `public/cure/drc.js` (~L923) | Closer excludes `.contains(e.target)` **and** `e.target.closest("[data-feature]")` (the dimmed opener buttons). |
| TIN mascot speech bubble (introspection) | `public/js/introspect-ui.js` `onOutside` / `dismissMascot` (~L413) | `pointerdown` capture; excludes `bubbleEl` + `mascotEl`; else waves the mascot goodbye. The "dismiss before the underlay acts" variant. |

**When adding a new bubble:** reuse `wireSettingPopovers` if it's a settings-row
detail; otherwise clone the closest table row's shape — persistent single-bound
closer, containment + opener exclusion, `closeAll`. Don't add a modal backdrop
to a speaker bubble; the outside-interaction dismissal *is* the backdrop.

**Not part of this convention (yet):** an `Escape`-to-close keybinding — these
bubbles dismiss on outside interaction only; the modal-style drawers/panels are
a separate surface. If Escape support is ever added, codify it here as its own
rule so it lands everywhere at once rather than one bubble at a time.

## UX-2 — Sandbox two-layer switch: a background tap swaps the foreground pane; message taps never switch; the background pane leans along in synchronization

**Rule.** While the execution sandbox is running (the agent backdrop has produced
output), the page holds **two stacked panes** — the CONVERSATION (`#chat`) and
the TERMINAL backdrop (`#dr-agent-backdrop`). A **tap on the bare page
background** — not on a message bubble, not on interactive chrome — **swaps which
pane is in front**: the front pane reads at full strength, the other recedes to a
faint background (`body.term-fg` → chat `opacity:.16`, backdrop rises to `z:4`
below the fixed chrome at `z:5`), with a quick **slide-in-from-the-right** on the
pane that just came forward. A tap that lands on a **user/assistant message** (or
any control) does its normal thing and **never switches**. A **swipe/drag** is
not a tap and never switches. Once in a mode, **scrolling the foreground pane
makes the background pane lean along in the same direction, weaker and shorter**
(a gentle parallax that springs back).

**Why.** The old design popped a full terminal panel open, which covered the
screen and broke the prompt-first flow. Two peers you flip between keep both the
conversation and the raw agent activity one tap away without either ever taking
the whole screen. The message-vs-background discrimination is load-bearing: users
must be able to select/tap message text and controls without the layer flipping
out from under them, so ONLY the empty field toggles.

**The mechanics that make it consistent (match all of these):**

1. **Tap detection is `pointerdown`→`pointerup`** (covers mouse + touch), gated by
   `isTapGesture` (small travel on both axes, short duration) so a swipe or a
   press-and-hold text-selection is excluded (`agent-backdrop-core.js`).
2. **The switch fires only on the bare background.** Both the press AND the
   release target must pass `isSwitchTarget` — not inside `BLOCK_SEL` (`.msg`,
   `.step`, `.activity`, controls, chrome, panels) and no active text selection.
   `.msg` is in `BLOCK_SEL`: **tapping a message never switches.**
3. **Gated on sandbox output** (`hasBackdropContent()` → a channel exists). Before
   the sandbox runs there is nothing to switch to, so background taps are inert
   and the page behaves normally.
4. **Never auto-pop.** New sandbox output does NOT bring the terminal forward on
   its own (that was the removed screen-covering behavior); the default stays
   conversation-forward and the user chooses to flip.
5. **Per-mode scrolling.** CONVO mode: conversation scrolls natively, the backdrop
   (background) leans via the `#chat` scroll listener. TERMINAL mode: a wheel/drag
   pages the command history and the conversation (background) leans. The lean is
   `parallaxFollow` (same direction as the scroll, gentler factor, capped) applied
   to the *background* pane and sprung back — distinct from the older opposite
   `parallaxNudge`.
6. **Reduced motion** skips the slide flourish (`prefers-reduced-motion`), keeping
   the instant opacity swap.

**Canonical implementation:** `public/js/agent-backdrop.js`
(`setLayerMode` / `slideInForeground` / `isSwitchTarget` / `scrollBackdrop` /
`leanChat` / `leanBackdrop` and the `wireScroll` gesture wiring) over the pure
core `public/js/agent-backdrop-core.js` (`nextLayerMode`, `isTapGesture`,
`parallaxFollow`); the `body.term-fg` styling + pane transitions live in
`public/css/app.css` (the two-layer-view-switch block). Pure logic is
Node-tested in `agent-backdrop-core.test.js`; the DOM glue is browser-verified
(tap-vs-message, swap opacity/z-index, tap-vs-swipe, both parallax directions).

## UX-2 — Animations are tier identity; privacy detail lives in Se/cure's ℹ privacy notice (rewritten 2026-07-16)

**Rule.** A step's WAITING SYMBOL is its **tier's own symbol**, on every
step: Se/cure wears the **pink umbrella** (→ the pink ✓), Se/rver the
**balloon** (→ the blue ✓). The animations are NOT a communication channel
about data exposure — no per-step channel badges, no per-step disclosure
finales (the 2026-07-15 per-task grammar was reverted the next day: "keep it
stringent and clean with the animations"). The privacy communication lives in
a readable **PRIVACY NOTICE** on Se/cure instead:

- The **privacy (i)** (`#privacybtn`) — an i-in-a-circle right after the
  Se/cure wordmark in the header (2026-07-16 owner directive, superseding the
  icon-row ℹ; the glyph was first an eye, swapped for the (i) by owner
  request 2026-07-17) — opens `#privacypop` at any time: what THIS session's CURRENT
  configuration sends where — model route (own key / local / borrowed proxy),
  web-search route (self / grant / off), recall embeddings, and the
  borrowed-allowance governance line — plus a follow-on link to the full
  documentation (`/cure/help/`). The popover anchors LEFT, under the brand
  that opens it; the (i)'s tap is excluded from the brand's intro-replay
  click.
- **Opening a shared secure workspace pops the notice automatically**, leading
  with what the workspace link carried — the privacy read-up for the specific
  workspace the user was handed, without them going looking.

**Why.** The owner's call: two tiers, two animations, each tied to its site —
stringent and clean. Honesty about data paths stays a first-class feature,
but as prose the user can actually read in one place, not as symbol grammar
they must decode per step.

**The mechanics:**

1. The notice text is PURE and Node-tested: `privacyNoticeLines(ctx)` in
   `public/js/drc-page-core.js` — paragraphs built from the session context
   (provider label, viaProxy, local, search route, embed provider,
   grantsConnected, workspaceName). An unknown search route reads as OFF —
   the notice never claims a send that may not happen.
2. `ctx` is gathered at OPEN time (`privacyCtx()`, `public/cure/drc.js`) from
   the same accessors the send path resolves (model pick, grant liveness,
   `directSearchActive`, `drcEmbedProvider`), so the notice always reflects
   the configuration as it stands.
3. Dismissal follows UX-1: any outside interaction closes the popover, the
   text inside stays selectable; the ℹ button itself toggles.
4. The standing one-liner beside the model picker (`providerVisibilityNote`)
   is unchanged — the notice is its long form.

**Canonical implementations:** `public/cure/drc.js` (`privacyCtx`,
`showPrivacyNotice`, the `unlockWorkspace` auto-pop), `public/cure/index.html`
(`#privacybtn` / `#privacypop`), `public/js/drc-page-core.js`
(`privacyNoticeLines`). Record: `docs/SYMBOL-LANGUAGE.md` §6.

## UX-3 — Mascot figures are first-visit-only pointers, never persistent; ambient animation stays low

**Rule.** When a tier has a mascot/figure (the ghost on Se/cure, the balloon
on Se/rver), it appears **once per browser** — for first-time visitors, chained
onto the first-visit intro animation's real play — delivers a few **pointers
on how the tier works** (a short speech-bubble script), then retires
(walks/climbs away) and **unmounts completely**. It is never mounted on a
routine boot; returning visitors get a clean page with no figure following
them around. Any tap dismisses it early (UX-1 — the bubbles hold no
interactive content). Separately, **ambient always-running animation is kept
at a LOW level**: background drifts slow enough to barely register, marker
events (the ghost-button glow/shimmer) rare (minutes apart, seconds long),
breathing loops slow. Functional motion — loading spinners, per-task finales —
is exempt: it communicates state.

**Why.** Owner directive (2026-07-15, F-16 round 4): "none of the sites should
have a persistent small figure following them around — we'd only need them for
first-time visitors to get some pointers on how things work following the
initial animation. Lower UX animation level." A figure that's always there
stops meaning anything and competes with the work; as a one-shot greeter it is
the tier's handshake.

**The mechanics that make it consistent:**

1. **Gate on the intro's real play**, not on a routine boot: /cure chains
   `startGhostStroll` + `showGhostSay` onto `maybePlayUmbrella`'s resolved
   `played`; /rver chains `showBalloonGreeter` (dynamic import) inside the
   landing intro's `onDone`. The intro itself is once-per-browser (seen-key
   set only after a real run), so the figure inherits that gate; `?anim=1`
   replays both.
2. **A bounded script, then self-retirement**: the ghost strolls its planned
   legs and `retire()`s; the balloon speaks `GREETER_LINES` (LINE_MS each)
   then `depart()`s (`departProgress`, DEPART_MS) and `unmount()`s —
   timers, listeners, and DOM all cleaned up.
3. **Dismiss on any interaction** (UX-1): the balloon binds one
   `pointerdown` capture listener on `document`; the figure layers are
   `pointer-events:none` so the same tap still reaches the app.
4. **Reduced motion**: the automatic first-visit play is suppressed with the
   intro; the forced `?anim=1` path shows a static figure and skips the
   animated departure.

**Canonical implementations:** `public/js/balloon.js`
(`showBalloonGreeter` / `speak` / `depart` / `unmount`; pure
`GREETER_LINES` / `departProgress` Node-tested in `balloon.test.js`),
`public/js/app.js` (the landing-intro `onDone` chain),
`public/cure/ghostwalk.js` (`startGhostWalk` / `retire`) + `public/cure/drc.js`
(`startGhostStroll` gated on `played`, `showGhostSay` with
`dr_secure_intro_seen`). Ambient levels: `public/css/app.css` (`bg-drift 52s`,
`ghost-glow`/`ghost-shimmer` 180s cycles), `public/cure/drc.css`
(`ghost-contour 7.2s`), `public/welcome/index.html` (the landing's matching
ghost cycle). Record: `docs/SYMBOL-LANGUAGE.md` §5, FEATURES.md F-16 round 4.

## UX-4 — A consent dialog's dismissal is a NO; only an explicit, cost-labeled button is a YES

**When** a dialog asks the user to approve something with a real cost —
bandwidth (a multi-GB model download), storage, spend — **then** every
dismissal path (outside/backdrop tap, an explicit "Not now", Escape, the ×)
means NO and does nothing, and the ONE affirmative button carries the cost in
its own label ("Download 3.9 GB", never a bare "OK"). The exact figure is
computed live (the model repo's file listing) before the button enables —
a consent over a guessed number isn't consent.

This deliberately inverts UX-1's spirit for a different dialog KIND: an
EXPLAINER (drspop, setting-pops, speech bubbles) can dismiss casually because
dismissing it costs nothing; a CONSENT dialog must never let the casual-tap
habit trigger the costly action. The two kinds may look similar (glass card),
so the affirmative button's cost label is the tell.

1. **Backdrop + "Not now" both just hide** the dialog; no state changes.
2. **The YES button states the cost** and stays disabled until the real
   figure is known (the live listing resolved).
3. **The reversal lives next to the consent**: whatever was approved shows a
   one-tap undo (the model row's Delete with its size) in the same surface.

**Canonical implementation:** the on-device model download consent —
`public/cure/index.html` `#odconsent`, `public/cure/drc.js`
`odOpenConsent()` (live-size fetch → size-labeled `#odc-yes`, backdrop/
`#odc-no` dismissal) and `renderOnDeviceRows()` (the Delete reversal row).
Record: docs/BONSAI-27B-PHONE-INFERENCE.md §6.

## UX-5 — A discoverability hint shown only on the empty state must be re-shown when the empty state is bypassed

**When** a how-to hint lives on the chat's empty state (the fresh-chat
`EMPTY_TEXT`) but the user can reach the same surface with the empty state
already gone — **reopening a saved conversation from history renders turns and
clears the empty hint** — **then** re-surface the hint in that path too, as a
transient cue that is NOT persisted and disappears on the next turn. A hint the
returning user never sees is a feature they can't discover.

The concrete case: feedback is filed by starting a chat message with the word
"feedback" (src/feedback.js `feedbackIntent`; the entry then enters the fix
loop). The only on-screen instruction for that was `EMPTY_TEXT`, which never
shows once a reopened history chat has rendered its turns — so a user who
opened an old session specifically to comment on it had no cue. The fix appends
a quieter `.feedback-hint` line below the restored turns.

1. **Gated to an answered record** — `shouldShowFeedbackHint(messages)` shows
   it only when there's an assistant turn to comment on (empty/user-only:
   nothing).
2. **Transient, never persisted** — appended after `renderStoredConversation`,
   removed by `clearEmpty()` (same lifecycle as the empty hint) the moment a
   new turn is added; it is never written to the history record.
3. **Quieter than a message** — smaller, muted, centered, so it reads as chrome
   not conversation.

**Canonical implementation:** `public/js/turns.js` (`FEEDBACK_HINT_TEXT`, pure
`shouldShowFeedbackHint` Node-tested in `turns.test.js`, `addFeedbackHint`
appended in `renderStoredConversation`; `clearEmpty` removes it),
`public/css/app.css` `.feedback-hint`. Server side of the same guarantee:
src/feedback.js `buildFeedbackContext` (the reopened chat's last Q&A is what the
feedback entry captures). Se/cure keeps no server feedback path (privacy
invariant 4) and gets no hint.
